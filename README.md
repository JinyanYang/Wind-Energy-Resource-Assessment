# Wind Energy Resource Assessment (CA1 Coursework Project)

This repository presents a wind energy resource assessment based on measured wind data and MATLAB analysis.  
The study includes statistical characterization of wind speed, Weibull distribution fitting, power curve analysis, and capacity factor estimation.

The work was originally completed as coursework and has been adapted here into a GitHub educational portfolio project.

## Project Overview

- Software: MATLAB  
- Focus: Wind speed analysis, Weibull distribution, and wind turbine performance evaluation  
- Objectives:  
  1. Perform statistical analysis of wind speed and direction  
  2. Fit Weibull distribution parameters (k, c)  
  3. Generate wind rose, duration curves, and power curve plots  
  4. Estimate energy yield and capacity factor

## Key Results

- Weibull distribution provided a good fit to the measured wind speed data  
- Wind rose revealed prevailing directions and turbulence characteristics  
- Predicted annual energy yield (~1.81 GWh) closely matched measured output (~1.80 GWh)  
- Capacity factor estimated at ~24.3%

## How to Use

1. Open `report/WindEnergy_CA1_Report.pdf` for detailed methodology and results.  
2. Place raw wind data (`.xls` or `.csv`) into `data/`.  
3. Add MATLAB scripts in `code/` to reproduce calculations and plots.  
4. Export plots into `figures/` and reference them here.
